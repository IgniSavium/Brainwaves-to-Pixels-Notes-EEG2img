ðŸ¥œ**TLDR**: Image reconstruction via training-free latent diffusion models ( Stable Diffusion) with fMRI inputs.

---

## Motivation

This research aims to improve the reconstruction of **high-resolution**, semantically accurate images from human brain activity (fMRI) using **training-free** **latent diffusion models (LDMs)**, addressing the limitations of previous deep generative models that required complex training and fine-tuning, by offering a more efficient and **interpretable** method with minimal computational cost.![image-20250721114158569](./High-resolution image reconstruction with latent diffusion models from human brain activity.assets/image-20250721114158569.png)

## Model

### Architecture

Overall a **Latent Diffusion Model** framework (actually `Stable Diffusion` ):
 $ \epsilon $ denotes an image encoder, $ D $ is a image decoder (they are a pair of autoencoder).

only train 2 (small linear) parts:

(1) fMRI -> original image latent $z$  (a simple coarse network approximation)

(2) fMRI -> conditional "text" (i.e. semantic) $c$

## Evaluation

 No comparable previous work exists, so this paper almost only provides ablation and visualization analysis.

### Ablation

Perceptual Similarity Metrics (PSMs):

$z$ represents the low-level semantics, and $c$ captures the high-level abstraction semantics.

##  Reverse Encoding Visualization

 Reversely map the features or components in the LDM BACK INTO the fMRI inputs (to find semantic relationships).

####  $z,c,z_c$ feature

Different latent representations (z, c, and $z_c$) show varying prediction performance across visual cortex regions, with z performing well in early visual cortex, c excelling in higher visual cortex, and $z_c$ closely resembling z in its performance, despite representing visually different images

#### $z,c$  semantic balancing with varying noise level

 As noise levels increased, the latent representation with added noise ($z_c$) predicted voxel activity in higher visual cortex better (ðŸ¤”thanks to high-level condition $c$) than the original representation ($z$)

#### $z, c$ semantic balancing at different denoising timesteps

 During the denoising process, early stages were dominated by the original image representation (z), while mid-stages saw the noise-added representation ($z_c$) ( ðŸ¤”thanks to high-level condition $c$) better predict activity in higher visual cortex.

#### denoise network per-layer semantic interpretation

The U-Net bottleneck layer initially captures the most information across the cortex, but as denoising progresses, **early U-Net layers** become more predictive of **early visual cortex** activity while the **bottleneck layer** shifts to representing **higher-level semantic information** in higher visual areas.
