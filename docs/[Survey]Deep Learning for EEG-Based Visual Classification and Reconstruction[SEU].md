##  Comparison with previous surveys

This review highlights EEG-based visual classification and reconstruction using deep learning, distinguishing itself from prior works in several ways:

- **Robinson et al.** focus on theoretical neural decoding, especially cognitive processes, but do not cover practical applications like image reconstruction. 
- **Wang et al.** center on GANs for EEG signal processing tasks like data augmentation and artifact removal (method-oriented perspective). 
- **Rakhimberdina et al.** explore deep learning for fMRI-based image reconstruction. However, EEG's high temporal resolution and low spatial fidelity pose different challenges.
- **Huang et al.** focus on fMRI-based visual decoding, whereas EEG faces more severe domain gap issues, which are a central concern of this review due to its temporal resolution and data variability.
- **Nestor et al.** discuss face image reconstruction from fMRI and behavioral data.

Overall, this review fills gaps by addressing **EEG**-specific challenges and offering a broader, **task-focused** perspective compared to existing surveys.

## Methods Summary

Generally utilize an **Encoder-Decoder** architecture.
