## About

Hi~ðŸ˜‰ Iâ€™m Ignisavium, a student passionate about EEG-based image reconstruction. These notes are part of my ongoing effort to organize and share knowledge on this fascinating topic. Feel free to explore my work or contribute on GitHub: [@ignisavium ](https://github.com/ignisavium). 

### Key Topics Covered

- ðŸ§ **Introduction**: Basics of EEG and image reconstruction techniques. ([EEG itself](Where Does EEG Come From and What Does It Mean.md); [Diffusion Model Intro](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18103)
- ðŸ“˜**Papers & Methods**: Insights from seminal studies and algorithms.
- ðŸ¤”**Reflections **: Limitations and future directions in the field.

In recent years, **Diffusion Model** has gradually become the mainstream of generative models due to its excellent performance and convenient integration features. Here we mainly focus on the **EEG to Image reconstruction** method based on diffusion.
