ü•ú**TLDR**: Regularize contrastive loss with **similarity-keeping term**

---

## Motivation

This paper aims to overcome the challenges of low signal-to-noise ratio and nonstationarity in EEG-based image decoding by proposing a self-supervised contrastive learning framework (MUSE) (similarity-keeping regularization term) with tailored EEG encoders, significantly outperforming prior methods in zero-shot image classification on large-scale datasets.

## Model

EEG encoder architecture: (üî•upstream spatial conv + Spatial-Then-Time/Time-Then-Spatial combination + Graph Attention)

regularize the standard contrastive loss with Similarity Keeping term:

ü§î*Innate character:* Similarity Keeping term keeps the distribution of similarities with negative samples

## Evaluation

SK term is helpful in Nerv-series architecture but not very helpful in MUSE-series.
