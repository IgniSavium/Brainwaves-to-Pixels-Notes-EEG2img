## Motivation

The paper aims to address the challenge of reconstructing high-quality, semantically accurate images from EEG signalsâ€”which suffer from **low signal-to-noise ratio** and **individual variability**â€”by proposing a novel diffusion-model-based framework (DM-RE21) that combines a robust EEG semantic feature extractor (EVRNet - one residual net) and a denoising diffusion module (EG-DDPM), overcoming the limitations of previous LSTM, CNN, VAE, and GAN-based approaches in terms of semantic fidelity, resolution, and generalizability.
